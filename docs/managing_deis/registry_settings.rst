Settings used by registry
---------------------------

====================================      =================================================================================
setting                                   description

The Deis registry component inherits from the Docker registry container, so additional configuration
options can be supplied. For a full explanation of these settings, see the Docker registry `README`_.

Using a custom registry image
-----------------------------
You can use a custom Docker image for the registry component instead of the image
supplied with Deis:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config registry set image=myaccount/myimage:latest

This will pull the image from the public Docker registry. You can also pull from a private
registry:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config registry set image=registry.mydomain.org:5000/myaccount/myimage:latest

Be sure that your custom image functions in the same way as the `stock registry image`_ shipped with
Deis. Specifically, ensure that it sets and reads appropriate etcd keys.
