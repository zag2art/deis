/deis/controller/port                     port of the controller component (set by controller)
/deis/controller/protocol                 protocol of the controller component (set by controller)

====================================      ===========================================================

Using a custom builder image
----------------------------
You can use a custom Docker image for the builder component instead of the image
supplied with Deis:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config builder set image=myaccount/myimage:latest

This will pull the image from the public Docker registry. You can also pull from a private
registry:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config builder set image=registry.mydomain.org:5000/myaccount/myimage:latest

Be sure that your custom image functions in the same way as the `stock builder image`_ shipped with
Deis. Specifically, ensure that it sets and reads appropriate etcd keys.
